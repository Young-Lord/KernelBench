"""
Reference implementation for the A-tier task kb_l3_31.

Copied verbatim from KernelBench/level3/31_VisionAttention.py. The A tier is audited with the
standard KernelBench rule set, which is the default when a problem
declares no TIER, so this file is the problem and nothing else. Do not
edit it: the submission is a separate module.

The module-level defaults below are the case-parameterisation surface.
The case driver appends overrides for them to instantiate each entry of
public_cases.json; the mapping from case field to variable name lives in
task.json under `case_parameters`.
